Next.js 13 introduces exciting capabilities for building robust API endpoints. In this post, we'll delve into the practical aspects of creating both GET and POST requests. Whether you're new to Next.js or looking to update your skills with the latest version, this guide will help you understand and implement these essential features.

## Creating a GET Request

Here's a simple example of setting up a GET request:

```tsx
export async function GET() {
    return new Response('Hi')
}
```


This function demonstrates the ease with which you can return a basic response. It's a straightforward method to start with API endpoints in Next.js 13.

## Crafting a POST Request

Next, let's look at a POST request:

```tsx
export async function POST(request: Request){
    const data = await request.json();
    console.log(data);
    
    return new Response("Nice")
}
```

This snippet showcases how to handle incoming data and respond. It's essential for scenarios where your application needs to process user input or data from other sources.

## Leveraging NextRequest and NextResponse

Next.js 13 also introduces `NextRequest` and `NextResponse`, offering more control and flexibility:

```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
    const url = request.nextUrl;
    return NextResponse.json({message: "Hi from API"})
}
```

This example illustrates how to use these new classes to handle requests and send JSON responses. It's a more advanced technique that can enhance your API's functionality.
