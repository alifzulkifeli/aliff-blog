# Building RESTful APIs with Go

## Understanding RESTful APIs
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web services. RESTful APIs are web services that adhere to these constraints, allowing for efficient communication over the internet by using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## Why Go for API Development?
Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It offers the following advantages for API development:

- Simplicity and Readability: Go's syntax is clean and concise, making it easy to learn and write.
- Performance: Being a compiled language, Go programs run fast and efficiently.
- Concurrency: Go's built-in support for concurrency allows it to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, a desirable feature for high-load API services.
- Rich Standard Library: Go's standard library comes packed with robust features for building web servers, handling I/O, and more.


## Building a Simple RESTful API
Now, let's create a simple RESTful API to understand the basics.

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Go module:
```sh
mkdir myapi
cd myapi
go mod init myapi
```

### Step 2: Write Your API Code
Create a file named main.go and add the following code to define a simple HTTP server that responds to a GET request:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
### Step 3: Run Your API
Run your API using the Go command:

```sh
go run main.go
```

Now, your API is accessible at http://localhost:8080. When you navigate to this URL, you should see a "Hello, World!" message.
